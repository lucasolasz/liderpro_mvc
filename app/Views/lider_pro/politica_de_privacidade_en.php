                Possibly at some point in your life on the Internet, you must have already received, in your mailbox (e-mail), advertising messages coming from people or companies that you have never heard of. This deplorable practice is known as "spam", and unfortunately it is common on the Internet. Liderpro Informática does not use these devices. Users do not receive unsolicited advertising emails at any time. All emails sent to our users are sent for one of the following reasons:
                <br>
                &#160;1. To notify you of information relating to the website and its operation;

                <br>
                Every time the user fills out any of the electronic registration or resume forms available on our website and sends it to us, the data will be automatically encrypted. As a result, from the moment the data leaves your computer until it reaches our server, it will be unrecognizable. After reaching our server, the data will be decrypted and stored legibly.
                <br>
                For this process to occur in the most perfect security, we use TLS encryption technology. In addition to using Locaweb as a website hosting provider; one of the best, largest and most secure website hosting in Brazil.
